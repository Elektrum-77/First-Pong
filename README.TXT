the default keys are :

	player1:
		up : z
		down : s
		boost : a
	
	player2:
		up : o
		down : l
		boost : i
	
The boost lets you go faster but if you used it too much you will be insvisible. But you will still be able to touch the ball ^^
To change the key just open playerse_key_config (you can open it with notepad) and modifie it. for further information about what key you can put just go an that website :
